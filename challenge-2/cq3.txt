Using the filter:
    (dns.resp.name == "broker.hivemq.com" ) && (dns.qry.type == 1)

We find the DNS request and response for the domain broker.hivemq.com.
The Ip addresses of the broker are:
    broker.hivemq.com: type A, class IN, addr 35.158.43.69
    broker.hivemq.com: type A, class IN, addr 35.158.34.213
    broker.hivemq.com: type A, class IN, addr 18.192.151.104

Packets to the broker can be filtered with:
    ip.dst in {35.158.43.69, 35.158.34.213, 18.192.151.104} 

To find the mqtt subscribe request, we filter on
    mqtt.cmd == 8
and the topic name contains "#"
    mqtt.topic contains "#"


Putting all the filters:
ip.dst in {35.158.43.69, 35.158.34.213, 18.192.151.104} 
    && mqtt.msgtype == 8 
    && mqtt.topic contains "#"

We get the list of six mqtt subscribe requests using multilevel wildcards.
    375     5.113041615     10.0.2.15	18.192.151.104	MQTT	80	Subscribe Request (id=3) [university/+/+/#]
    2442    13.175483992	10.0.2.15	18.192.151.104	MQTT	87	Subscribe Request (id=5) [university/room0/room1/#]
    3293	20.163021204	10.0.2.15	18.192.151.104	MQTT	70	Subscribe Request (id=10) [house/#]
    3303	20.224858918	10.0.2.15	18.192.151.104	MQTT	75	Subscribe Request (id=9) [university/#]
    3362	21.206357493	10.0.2.15	18.192.151.104	MQTT	94	Subscribe Request (id=15) [university/building2/section0/#]
    3693	26.268559277	10.0.2.15	18.192.151.104	MQTT	91	Subscribe Request (id=13) [factory/department3/floor0/#]

However this does not tell us how many different clients are sending these requests.
To do this we have to look at the ip address and tcp port of the source,
If these two are the same for two packets, then they are from the same client.

In the end we find a total of 4 different clients sending the subscribe requests.
